<h1>Notes for contributors</h1>
To be of real use, the web site needs to grow from this small beginning. Contributions of collections of probate inventories are invited for inclusion on this site. The name of the transcriber will be fully acknowledged. Initially, contact my son David Emms [david_emms@hotmail.com].
<ol>
<li>The collection should be of inventories and, ideally, of wills associated with them (if they survive).</li>
<li>The inventories and wills should be accurately transcribed and complete. Where the original inventory has missing portions or the text is obscured in places and neither can be restored by the contributor, then it is unusable. The number of unusable inventories should be mentioned in the assurance to be given in (iv).</li>
<li>The geographical area and the date-span that the collection covers must be stated, together with the number of wills, of inventories and of persons that they relate to.</li>
<li>The contributor needs to give an assurance that all the available inventories relating to that date-span and area are in the collection. 'Available' means surviving to modern times.</li>
<li>The collection that arrives from the contributor should be as a digital document e.g in HTML format.  But let us know if that is going to be difficult for you.</li>
